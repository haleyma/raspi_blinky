# raspi_blinky
## Blink an LED from your browser two different ways

### What is this About?

This code is designed to show three different ways to control an LED
attached to a Raspberry Pi from a remote browser. Two are with cgi-bin
and a web server, and one is with a stand-alone python daemon using
the [Cherry Py web framework]( http://cherrypy.org).


### Prerequisites

This project uses the current stock Python on Raspian Stretch (9.0),
which as of this writing is 2.7.13.

I used 2017-11-29-Raspbian_stretch_lite for this project, directly
from the
[Raspbian downloads
page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).  I assume an
already set up Raspberry Pi. You will need to install the lighttpd
package:
``` apt-get install lightttpd ```


You will also need Cherry Py 14.0.0 or better. The version in the
Stretch repository is seriously out of date, so I downloaded it from
cherrypy.org and installed from source.  Fortunately it is all-python,
so installation is not too hirsute.  I experimented with the python
pip installer but was not able to make this work.
